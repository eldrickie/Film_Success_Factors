# Microsoft Studio Preliminary Research

------------------
## Overview
##### Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. The analyses in this research aim to uncover some properties successful movies have, so that Microsoft can get a good footing in the world of the film industry. The research looks at boxoffice success in relation to movie genre, production budget, and month of release.

-------------------
### Business Problem
##### Microsoft needs to build parameters inside which they can start creating original video content. The three questions this research answers are: which genre earns the most per film? Which genre earns the most per film in comparison to its budget? Which month of release will allow Microsoft to maximize earnings?
-------------------
### Data
##### The data this research uses are taken from the following services/websites:
###### [Internet Movie Datebase](https:://https://www.imdb.com)
##### [Box Office Mojo](https:://boxofficemojo.com)
-------------------
### Strategies
###### By looking at genres, budgets, and releases, the research aims to cite three metrics for success for Microsoft to release and profit from each film they release
----------------
### Results
##### - The top three performing genres in both domestic and foreign boxoffices are sci-fi, adventure, and animation
##### - The earnings to production budget ratio suggests that music, sport, and horror content make more money in relation to production costs. However sci-fi and animation provide similar ratios while yielding higher mean gross.
##### - Films released during the months of June and November reported highest mean boxoffice earnings
------------------
### Conclusion 
##### Using these metrics, will allow Microsoft to predictively gauge the successes of future films while allowing for flexibility. For example, the new studio may choose to release films which focus on maximizing individual movie earnings by shooting an adventure film and aim to release it in June. Another tactic the studio can implement is to release music or sport themed films. Releasing a large volume of such films compounds good profits in relation to production costs. The studio may choose to stagger the releases between the summer months and the holiday season in order to cast a wider net.
---------------------
### Looking Ahead
##### - Looking at which genres earned the most per month could determine what type of movie to release in a given month.
##### - Determining which actors and directors involved with the highest grossing films, may provide Microsoft with a pool of cast and crew from which to choose.
##### - Calculating which movies did poorly and in which genres they occured the most would allow Microsoft to know what properties to avoid
